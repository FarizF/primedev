      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm Fariz, and I'm a software engineering student at the Amsterdam
        University of Applied Sciences. I am currently based in Almere, the
        Netherlands. During my studies at the AUAS, I have been active as a (Wordpress) web
        developer and as an Android app developer creating
        <a href="/portfolio">solutions</a> for many companies, both locally and
        internationally recognized. I aspire to always improve, and create good-looking,
        complete, digital solutions that puts smiles on the faces of those I
        create them for.
